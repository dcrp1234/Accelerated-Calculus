# Accelerated-Calculus

This repository contains two projects demonstrating advanced calculus concepts using Python. These projects explore the mathematical theory, computational methods, and graphical visualizations of various topics in calculus.

- **Part 1:** 
  - Computing the **arc length** of curves, including the perimeter of an ellipse using elliptic integrals and Ramanujan's approximation.
  - Investigating the **curvature** of parametric curves, such as the Lemniscate of Bernoulli, with interactive visualizations.
  
- **Part 2:** 
  - Visualizing **quadratic surfaces** (ellipsoids, hyperboloids, and cylinders) and their geometric interpretations.
  - Computing **surface areas** for spheres and ellipsoids using numerical integration.
  - Analyzing and visualizing **gradient fields** for scalar functions in 2D and 3D.

These notebooks use Python libraries for numerical computation and plotting to provide an intuitive and interactive approach to understanding calculus.
